vehicle store- needs to have dialog updated, fix list of objects
weapon/gear store- need to make a list of guns/attachments/uniforms
fortifications- need to make a list of fortifications

add some side-neutral cash-only shops.

money system/scoring system- event handlers of some sort?
	points for wounding enemy players when friendly finishes them off
	points for destroying enemy vehicles

base radar
	-if enemy is within range, change color of marker.
	-hide radar marker from enemy teams.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Polish things for later:
how many times will a base be destroyed?(Should we make more base spawn markers?)
create dialog for bomb interaction
pretty up closing end-mission things.
	-Idea: stop player movement and then force everyone into a camera that spawns near the last destroyed tower, then "endMission"
check crew placement on attach bomb addaction
	https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCargo
R3F config for specific vehicles
	-how much cargo can each vehicle hold?
	-what can be put in as cargo, how much space does it take?
Change functions to complilefinal. Holy shit thats going to be hard.
Set objectives to tasks? BIS_fnc_setTask -no clue on this stuff. Not much documentation on the surface.

**Should we replace the bomb addaction with a GUI arm/disarm function?
This will make it easier to set counters and handle who can and can't manage it.
Will look more professional as well.
Arm/Disarm Dialog:
top center has a bomb status and timer.
Status: Locked/Stable/Armed X digit randomizer in top left that brings up a random
code when you open the dialog. Below the code display is AF's keypad script in the
bottom left with a display for entering code. Right side has buttons
(in order top to bottom) arm bomb, disarm bomb, cancel(closes the display)
PLayers must match the code on the top with the keypad, then hit the arm or disarm button.

this setVariable ["R3F_LOG_disabled", false];

Duration of arming animation: client\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 17
Duration of disarming animation: client\Diarm_Bomb.sqf line 9
Length of Countdown Timer: server\Bomb_Countdown_Detonate.sqf line 9
