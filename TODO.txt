server\Bomb_Spawn.sqf, line 7 : forgot to put in vehicle type for the device.
*****check distance to arm bomb on respawn tower. May have an issue.

attach/unattach to trucks:
load bomb onto truck: addaction condition: player distance the_bomb < 3 && (The_Bomb distance truck1 or The_Bomb distance truck2 or The_Bomb distance Truck3)

player base respawns- SHK pos circle with blacklist around base itself.
	-Random vehicles(truck/quad)spawn as well.

design base prefabs

base logistics- vehicle factory, barracks, base parts factory, resource deposit, ect...

resource missions

money system-
	points for arming bomb
	points for disarming bomb
	points for surviving bomb detonation if you armed it
	points for depositing resources
	points for killing enemy players
	points for destroying enemy vehicles

base radar

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Polish things for later:
how many times will a base be destroyed?(Should we make more base spawn markers?)
create dialog for bomb interaction
increase blast radius to take out helicopter tail rotors
Configure R3F transport values, disallow heli towing of trucks

**Should we replace the bomb addaction with a GUI arm/disarm function?
This will make it easier to set counters and handle who can and can't manage it.
Will look more professional as well.
Arm/Disarm Dialog:
top center has a bomb status and timer.
Status: Locked/Stable/Armed X digit randomizer in top left that brings up a random
code when you open the dialog. Below the code display is AF's keypad script in the
bottom left with a display for entering code. Right side has buttons
(in order top to bottom) arm bomb, disarm bomb, cancel(closes the display)
PLayers must match the code on the top with the keypad, then hit the arm or disarm button.
