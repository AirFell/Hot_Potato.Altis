copy-pasta base_obj scripts for each side, spawn & respawn.

addactions for each unique ID- sideswitch execvm

base logistics- vehicle factory, barracks, base parts factory, resource deposit, ect...

money system/scoring system- event handlers of some sort?
	points for arming bomb
	points for disarming bomb
	points for surviving bomb detonation if you armed it
	points for depositing resources
	points for killing enemy players*-kind of done. Needs testing
	points for wounding enemy players when friendly finishes them off
	points for destroying enemy vehicles

resource missions

add money-only vehicle stores. This should add balance for those without bases/access
to high end stuff. Should these be static or spawn in random places every mission?

base radar
	-if enemy is within range, change color of marker.
	-hide radar marker from enemy teams.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Polish things for later:
how many times will a base be destroyed?(Should we make more base spawn markers?)
create dialog for bomb interaction
pretty up closing end-mission things.
	-Idea: stop player movement and then force everyone into a camera that spawns near the last destroyed tower, then "endMission"
check crew placement on attach bomb addaction

R3F config for specific vehicles
	-what helis can pick up what vehicles.
	-add vehicles that can hold items ect...
Change functions to complilefinal. Holy shit thats going to be hard.
Set objectives to tasks? BIS_fnc_setTask -no clue on this stuff. Not much documentation on the surface.

**Should we replace the bomb addaction with a GUI arm/disarm function?
This will make it easier to set counters and handle who can and can't manage it.
Will look more professional as well.
Arm/Disarm Dialog:
top center has a bomb status and timer.
Status: Locked/Stable/Armed X digit randomizer in top left that brings up a random
code when you open the dialog. Below the code display is AF's keypad script in the
bottom left with a display for entering code. Right side has buttons
(in order top to bottom) arm bomb, disarm bomb, cancel(closes the display)
PLayers must match the code on the top with the keypad, then hit the arm or disarm button.
