attach/unattach to trucks
bomb map marker-simple map marker update on a whiletrue-do loop. Sleep 30 seconds.

"base" respawn script-
	side switch of off "this select 1" in init script.

Polish things for later:
create dialog for bomb interaction


**Should we replace the bomb addaction with a GUI arm/disarm function?
This will make it easier to set counters and handle who can and can't manage it.
Will look more professional as well.
Arm/Disarm Dialog:
top center has a bomb status and timer.
Status: Locked/Stable/Armed X digit randomizer in top left that brings up a random
code when you open the dialog. Below the code display is AF's keypad script in the
bottom left with a display for entering code. Right side has buttons
(in order top to bottom) arm bomb, disarm bomb, cancel(closes the display)
PLayers must match the code on the top with the keypad, then hit the arm or disarm button.
