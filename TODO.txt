_____________________________________________________________________________________
Polish things for later:
how many times will a base be destroyed?(Should we make more base spawn markers?)
create dialog for bomb interaction

**Should we replace the bomb addaction with a GUI arm/disarm function?
This will make it easier to set counters and handle who can and can't manage it.
Will look more professional as well.
Arm/Disarm Dialog:
top center has a bomb status and timer.
Status: Locked/Stable/Armed X digit randomizer in top left that brings up a random
code when you open the dialog. Below the code display is AF's keypad script in the
bottom left with a display for entering code. Right side has buttons
(in order top to bottom) arm bomb, disarm bomb, cancel(closes the display)
PLayers must match the code on the top with the keypad, then hit the arm or disarm button.

this setVariable ["R3F_LOG_disabled", false];

Variables that need to be adjusted for gameplay:
Bomb marker timer: server\Bomb_Marker.sqf line 2
Bomb arm addaction range of enemy base: client\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 92
Bomb arm range of enemy base: clinet\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 9
Duration of arming animation: client\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 17
Duration of disarming animation: client\Diarm_Bomb.sqf line 9
Length of Countdown Timer: server\Bomb_Countdown_Detonate.sqf line 9
Range of Damage from "explosion": server\Bomb_Countdown_Detonate.sqf line 21
Bomb respawn delay: server\BombRespawn.sqf line 9
